tabular.js
==========

A responsive table plugin for jQuery.

Usage
-----

Include it at the bottom of your page:

```html
<script src="tabular.js"></script>
```

Add the `data-tabular` attribute to your table tags:

```html
<table class="table table-bordered" data-tabular="responsive">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>ABC</th>
          ...
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>123</td>
          ...
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

And sit back and watch the magic happen...
